Designed to act as a frontend news service, this project combines with the [Shrelly Mail API](https://shrelly-mail-online.herokuapp.com/api), designed in [a previous project](https://github.com/ZanClifton/shrelly-mail-api), to create a fully functioning website.

Existing users are able to browse articles by topic, as well as to join discussions by commenting on them. A 'vote' feature is enabled for users to quickly respond to articles they liked or disliked. Further functionality is planned, including creating new articles, users and topics, voting on comments, and more!

The above commands will also enable you to check your own versions in the terminal. It is recommended you update both packages to their most recent versions prior to working with this app if you wish to test and develop it further.
